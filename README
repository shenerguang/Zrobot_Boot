Welcom to Zybo Robot Boot Repo!

You can download "ready to download" folder to the fat partition
and ubuntu filesystem https://github.com/shenerguang/Zrobot_Ubuntu
and enjoy zrobotIV for zybo.


Or you can download raw and maybe change your bit file,
and merge changes into devicetree dts file and recompile it to dtb
and change kernel configurations to support externel peripherals.

Thank you!
