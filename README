Welcom to Zed Robot Boot Repo!

If you want run the whole demo immediately,
You can download "ready to download" folder to the fat partition,
And download another repo named "Zrobot_Ubuntu" to the ext partition.
https://github.com/shenerguang/Zrobot_Ubuntu

Or you can download raw and maybe change your bit file,
and merge changes into devicetree dts file and recompile it to dtb
and change kernel configurations to support externel peripherals.

Thank you!
